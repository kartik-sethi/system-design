/**
 * A thread-safe singleton class that provides methods for printing to the
 * console.
 * <p>
 * This class follows the Singleton design pattern, ensuring only one instance
 * is created and providing
 * thread-safe methods for printing various types of data to the console. It
 * also includes a method to print
 * timestamps.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The class ensures that all print operations are thread-safe using a
 * {@link ReentrantLock}, and the singleton
 * instance is lazily initialized to avoid unnecessary creation of the object.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <strong>Usage Example:</strong>
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * SingletonThreadSafePrinter printer = SingletonThreadSafePrinter.instance();
 * printer.print("Hello World");
 * printer.println(123);
 * printer.printTimeStamp();
 * }</pre>
